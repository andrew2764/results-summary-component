## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- BEM
- Mobile-first

### What I learned

Reinforcing what I already know. I can now directly write most of the code without looking anything up.

### Continued development

I'm continuing to use BEM as the naming convention in my CSS. Though naming things continue to be a challenge. I anticipate it to get much more difficult in larger projects.

I also didn't do the bonus challenge this time. Perhaps I will revisit this challange to do it when I'm more confident in using JS.
